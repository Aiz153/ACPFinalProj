# Anime Game.py is the main game/driver code that compile the three games and AnimeGameinfo.py is where it's multiple inheritance happen.

1."One Piece"

 The Famous Anime that familiar game Street Fighter  is played like this: at the same time, two players(one user, one computer) displays Some character in a Certain Anime. All characters have differents abilities and specialties

2."Naruto Shippuden"

 Lets you pick a characters of another famous anime Naruto Shippuden. Play the game between that computer action and the user,  true randomness abilities of Characters and the luck factor you may win the games.

# Demo


It shows how the program executed. You'll also learn how Used The The Characters Special Attack, and you'll find suggestions counter attack for next steps, so you can start and learn from it.

Overall, in this tutorial, you'll quickly run through the basics of battling with fighterBot and learn how Python allows you to get fun and useful results without needing to write a lot of code.


# Project Overview

It is a game where it's opponents is a bot/computer. The user will pick randomly character on a list. And once the user done with picking the computer also pick a random characters and the battles will start

You can build a or create a match by training it with relevant data. Additionally, our one piece program will remember user responses and continue building its internal graph structure to improve the responses that it can given.


# Project Assesment


1. Code Reusability- 4 (Practices DRY(Do no Repeat Yourself) method excellently, leading to a shorter and cleaner program structure.)
2. Maintainability- 2 (The program implemented OOP principles but was not effective and does not help in the maintainability of the program. Debugging can become very challenging.)
3. Scalability- 4 (The program has high potentials for adapting new features, immediate changes, and can handle minor and major updates with less difficulty than usual.)
4. Execution- 4 (The program is fully functional as declared and intended with additional features that exceed the requirements of the course. Handling of errors are remarkably done. Some operations even use appropriate algorithms to improve cost-efficiency and overall performance.)
5. Originality- 4(The quality and creativity of output is remarkable and formidable. Output is original)
6. Overall impresion- 4(The program runs smoothly without noticeable bugs or errors.)
